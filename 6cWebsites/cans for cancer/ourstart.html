  <h1>Our Start</h1>
  <p>Hey There,
  I am Brooke McEntire, and I started Cans for Cancer when I was 12. I was inspired to do this because my family has a history of cancer and I know how expensive care is.
  I wanted to help all of the indivduals who struggle to make ends meet while dealing with a time consuming disease. I also know that we have a major polution issue on earth
  so I wanted to make a difference and boom cans for cancer began! to find out more email us at learn@cansforcancer.org
