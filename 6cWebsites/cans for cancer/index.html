  <h1>Our Goal</h1>
  <p> Cans for cancer was created with three goals. First to help people who can't afford the radiation, 
  surgeries, and cocktails of chemotherapy drugs that they bravely endure to return to their everyday lives.
  Second to offer care for all, at Cans for Cancer we made our logo rainbow because we offer care to everyone no matter who you are though we always love to talk to the patients we help.
  Lastly is what makes Cans for Cancer so special we gain our money from recycling cans for change. By recycling these cans at machines
  ,which are located at many stores, dumps, and other public areas, not only are we offering care and money for a cure we are also tackling our ever growing issue of pollution.
