  <p>Important Information</p>
<p>Basics of the Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rule:</p>
 
<p>Changes to the Loan and Settlement Disclosure forms went into effect October 3, 2015.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 mandates the combination of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) loan disclosures with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) Good Faith Estimate and HUD-1 Settlement Statement disclosures. 
 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an entity created by the Dodd-Frank Act, issued a new TILA final regulation that, among other things, created two new forms, the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure and new 3 business day delivery requirements.</p>
 
 

<p>Impact on Real Estate Closings:</p>
â€‹
<p>Closings may now take longer due to 3 day review periods. Click here for a look at a Loan Estimate Delivery Calendar Example. 
 
Forms are different effective October 3, 2015.
 
The Closing Disclosure replaces the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and the TIL Disclosure.  All contact information, including license numbers must appear on the Closing Disclosure.
 
The Loan Estimate replaces the Good Faith Estimate.  Lenders are required to furnish the Loan Estimate to mortgage applicants within 3 days of application. 
 
Clients may receive multiple Loan Estimates due to changed circumstances that trigger a 3 day waiting period.
 
Lenders will be very cautious in light of substantial penalties that can be issued by the CFPB for non compliance.</p>
 

 
 

<p>Real Estate Agents:</p>
 
<p>As the point of contact for most real estate transactions, real estate professionals will be affected by a number of rules and regulations put forth by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
 
You will need to be able to talk your clients through the new forms resulting from the proposed mortgage disclosure rule, which will also affect the timing of your closing transaction with a mandatory three-day notification for both the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure.
 
Now more than ever you'll need to work hand in hand with real estate professionals you trust.  So learn as much as you can about the new rules and prepare for the changes in the transaction process ahead of time.  For more information on what you can do to prepare click here.
