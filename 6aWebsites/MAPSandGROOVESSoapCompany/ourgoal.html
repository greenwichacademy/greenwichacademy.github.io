  <h1>Our Goal</h1>
  <p>Promoting personal hygenie. We know that not everyone has good materials for personal hygeine. 
  In fact did you know that more than  % doesn't take more than baths per week? This is where M&GSC comes in! 
  We help support natural soap and help keep it in use, and not in the back of a dusty shelf in a store with forty different kinds of junkie ones! 
  We are here to make everyone clean in the world!</p>
  <p> We are a non profit organization that lives by our motto," Lather up the less fortunate and the fortunate". 
 As our Earth gets older, it will no longer have such abundant resources, and we are using up much too fast.
 At Maps and Grooves Soap Company  we are looking to make strategic use of these resourses and what we have left. All over the world every day there is unneeded soap being made in single spots, so let us share all that soap! 
 To see an example of organic soap made with hard work, that we use, please click the link below! Thank you! </p>
