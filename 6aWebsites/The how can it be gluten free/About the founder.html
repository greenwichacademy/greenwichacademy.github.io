  <h1>About the Founder and the store's main aim</h1>
  <p>The How can it be Gluten Free was founded by Charlotte after realising how few stores were completely gluten free.
 After going to bakeries and seeing how many people were in need for a place where everything is alright to eat.
 Charlotte has Coeliac disease and found out in September of 2015 at 11 years of age. 
 Her younger sister Clementine (Clemi) also has Coeliac disease but found out in the summer of 2015 when she was only 5. 
 Charlotte and her sister had a big loss being part french. 
 Her main aim is to help those who were and are in the same position she was and still is in.
