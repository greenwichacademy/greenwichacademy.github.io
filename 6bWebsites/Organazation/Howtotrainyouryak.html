  <h1>How to train your yak!</h1>
  <p>Yaks are not legally allowed to be kept as pets, but this website allows you to have one at your door in minutes (if your door is still there after the yak arrives) The first step in training your yak is to meet your yak. If the yak seems vicious (common signs are: ripping sofas in half, causing fires, causing floods, and attacking humans). Once you get to know your yak, make it sit. Make it sit by yelling at it until it does something resembling sitting. </p> 
  <p>If anyone happens to find your yak and report you, run as fast as you can and don't sue this website.</p
